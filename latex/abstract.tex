The effect of noise on man and on the environment can be quite drastic. 
This paper addresses three methods to characterize the acoustical properties of noise barriers.

First, measurements on a scale model of a simple noise barrier are described and performed. Low signal to noise ratios are taken into account, as well as the atmospherical attenuation of high frequencies.

Next, these measurements are compared to the result of a finite difference time domain simulation of that same setup. The use of a staggered grid and the correction from 2D simulation to 3D scale model are explained.

Using these measurements, reflection and refraction in the near field are briefly discussed.

Lastly, a novel method for in situ measurements is given and compared to the Adrienne method. Several flaws of the latter method are touched upon and improvements are given in situations that permit them.
